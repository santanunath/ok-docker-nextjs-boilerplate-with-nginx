### Tested: ok (in RPi3b+)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tech Stack
- Nextjs (v13.4.12)
- Reactjs (v18.2.0")
      
## Nextjs v13.4/14/15 application structure 
'public' and 'app' folders are created automatically.   
- all 'pages' in nextjs must be defined inside folder /app/
- default Home page (page.js) is define inside folder /app/
- You can start editing the Home page by modifying 'app/page.js'

## How to run this application (without Docker)


Install the dependencies: (listed in package.json file)

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```


Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev âœ“
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://host_ip:3000](http://rpi_ip:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the Home page by modifying

```bash
app/page.js
```

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
